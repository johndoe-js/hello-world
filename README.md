# hello-world
I have absolutely no idea what's going on but this is pretty much just the results of a tutorial.
Hi, I'm a human and I like robots! 
Unfortunatley, since I can't upload my entire consciousness to one, I'll have to settle with making things to represent the thoughts in my consciousness.
I bet in years, I'll look back on this and think, "wow, what an annoying kid I was."
Chances are higher though that I will forget about this completely and it'll all be lost to the void. 
Oh well! 
This was supposed to be information about me. Well, I'm self-absorbed as you can see by the many lines of nonsense I've written, and I am trying to learn computer science stuff to avoid doing english homework.
